            <h1>History of JDM</h1>
            <p>The origins of JDM culture can be traced back to the 1950s and 60s, 
                when Japan was rebuilding its economy after World War II. As the 
                country's <br>automotive industry began to flourish, young Japanese 
                car enthusiasts started modifying their vehicles for performance 
                and style.</p>

            <h3>JDM Culture Today</h3>
            <p>As JDM culture gained popularity, it also started to branch out into different subcultures. 
                Drifting, a high-speed driving technique that involves sliding the car around corners, 
                became popular in Japan in the 1990s and eventually gained a global following.</p>
